# 3 Concern Resolution Process

We strive to immediately resolve concerns of all team members.  Concerns are resolved using the following process:

* Team members who feel comfortable raising their concerns publicly are given time at work hours to express their concern and propose a resolution.  
  * Concerns raised in an entire team setting should not be intended to degrade, embarrass, or minimize any member of the team.
  * Concerns about specific individuals should be first raised to a member of Core Leadership so they may determine the appropriate method to proceed to ensure all involved parties can be treated respectfully.  
* Time is given to the team to ask clarifying questions to understand the concern.
* The team conducts a Heads-Down-Hands-Up vote on whether or not they feel it is a team concern that needs to be resolved.
  * If the team feels it is a concern, the team will proceed to resolution.
  * If the team feels it is not a concern, no further action is taken.
  * If the team is unable to agree upon a solution to the concern, the Core Leadership will convene to develop solutions to be presented to the entire team.
