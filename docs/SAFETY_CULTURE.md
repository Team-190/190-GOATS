# 1 Safety Culture
Safety is the responsibility of everyone on the team.  We must look out for each other at all times and speak out if we see something wrong.  

If you are doing something and are corrected by a teammate, thank them for their concern.  It is never appropriate to get upset or retaliate against someone for looking out for you.

Team members should always speak up when they are concerned or unsure about a situation, whether to a peer or superior.  If you do not feel comfortable raising the concern directly with the person, immediately report the issue to the Team Leader who can take action.  When appropriate, that report can remain anonymous.  

Some examples of times you need to speak up:
* Improper use of safety glasses and improper dress for workspaces
* Improper use and maintenance of tools
* Fooling around near others working
* Operating machinery when not in the proper mental state (e.g. overtired)
* Skipping class or important school assignments to participate in the team
* Not taking care of their mental or physical well-being  
* Improper relationships between mentors and students
* Bullying or harassing behavior
