# 4 Attendance Standards 

Attendance is taken at every team meeting by sign-in and sign-out. You are required to notify team leadership in advance about late arrivals and absences. You should contact leadership via Slack as soon as possible, preferably at least 24 hours in advance. Longer absences should be communicated earlier. 

In addition to signing in, select mentors will be asked to evaluate the contributions of team members during their time and designate it as follows:
* Present 
  * Being physically present is not enough—team members must be attentive and productive during meeting time to be marked “present.” Present markings will count positively towards your attendance percentage. 
  * To be marked present, the team member must 
    * Be active and productive for the time they are signed in.
    * Participate in the ‘Clean 15’ prior to their departure.
* Absent Made Up & Partial Made Up 
  * For notified absences, you have the ability to make up the missing time.  It is YOUR responsibility to proactively ask for work to make up and/or attend on another day to make up hours (Wednesday or alternative weekend day).
* Unproductive 
  * If you are not sufficiently productive or are distracting others during a meeting, you may be marked “unproductive.” You will be given warnings when you are marked unproductive so you know what behavior was at fault and should not be repeated. Being marked “unproductive” will count negatively towards your attendance percentage and cannot be made up. 

## 4.1 Interval Team Member Evaluations 
The team roster will be regularly re-evaluated to ensure that only those who are committed will remain eligible for Varsity Team. In general, those below 85% attendance rate will be considered for re-evaluation. Anyone below the 85% threshold for the current term will be notified by a member of leadership, as a warning. Final decisions for removal from varsity status based on attendance will be made throughout the year. 

There will be strict Varsity Status Reviews at/on:
* The end of B-term
* The 3rd weekend of February
* The Monday prior to each competition

Removal from the varsity team will also take into consideration issues outside of attendance. Dismissal for reasons other than attendance will be handled using the procedure outlined in Section 1.8 Consequences. 

Reason for dismissal may include, but is not limited to: 
* Behavior in and outside of team meetings
* Initiative
* Work ethic
* Contribution to team environment 

Team Leaders will talk to students that are not meeting the requirements necessary to stay on the Varsity Team or have exhibited behavior that puts them at risk of being removed from the team. 

## 4.2 Mental Health Days 
FRC190 recognizes that balancing the robotics season with school, family, and other responsibilities can become stressful and wear on a person’s mental and physical health. The health of each person is always our first priority and thus we offer members the option of Mental Health Days. When needed, every Varsity Team Member may make use of a Mental Health Day, where they can choose to either arrive late to a meeting, leave early, or not attend. There is no defined reason to use a Mental Health Day—mounting stress, family responsibilities, and other events are all equally valid. Unless your use of mental health days become excessive, there will be no questions asked. In the case of excessive usage, the Team Leaders will speak with you about the circumstances and the best way for you to proceed. You must notify leadership in advance when possible and the absence will not count negatively towards your percentage.
