# 2 Injuries

If at any point there is an injury suffered by someone within our space, it is to be reported immediately to the closest RRC staff member.  

## 2.1 Minor First Aid
* First Aid Kits are located in the lab, practice field, and in the shop.  
* If at any time you find a first aid kit short on supplies, report it to the Operations Manager.

## 2.2 Eye Wash
* Eye Wash is available in the Shop next to the sink.

## 2.3 Emergency Shower
* An emergency shower is located in the loading dock close to the Practice Field.

## 2.4 Entanglement
* If a person is at risk of becoming or becomes entangled in a machine:
* Immediately hit the Emergency Stop on the machine or on the wall.  This will immediately stop power to the machine(s).
* Designate a specific person to call for emergency help if necessary.
* If safe to do so, use trauma shears, located near each machine, to cut the entanglement.

## 2.5 Medical Emergencies
* In the case of a severe injury or medical incident, do not hesitate to call for first responders.  The fastest way is by dialing 508-831-5555 for Campus Police.  
* They will dispatch the appropriate on and off campus services.  They can also be reached by dialing 5555 on any campus phone or pressing the emergency button on any blue light box (located at the front of 15 Sagamore or by the townhouses out of the back).
* If the person is suffering from major bleeding, designate a person to retrieve the Stop Bleed Kit from the machine shop (near sink) and provide assistance if you are able.  

__You will never be admonished or punished for hitting an e-stop or calling for help.  Weâ€™d rather have to restart a part than risk serious injury!__
