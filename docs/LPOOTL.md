# CLEAN 15 CHECKLIST (Must be completed daily)

## Tools:
__ If you remove a tool from the pit case YOU must return it when work is done.  The pit cases are intended to be complete at all times so we know where key items are and do not require searching to prep the pit for an event.
__ Broken tools should be reported and discarded.  Critical time is wasted if someone needs a tool, finds it broken, and has no way to complete their task.

## Area:
__ All table surfaces emptied including, field side table (pool table), computer tables, lab tables, and shop tables.   
__ Each machine in the shop was cleared of chips, tooling, and tools.  
__ Material scraps sorted accordingly or moved to recycling.
__ The floor of all spaces swept.
__ Trash thrown in a bin with a bag.  If there is no bag, put one in.
__ All tools in their appropriate toolbox/storage location at the end of each meeting.  If you donâ€™t know where it goes, ask.
__ All cabinet doors shut and drawers closed.
__ All chairs stacked neatly by type.
__ All bins stowed into the pit case or their proper location.
__ All movers in the shop or lab area.
__ Tablets for movers plugged in to charge.
__ All CAD laptops are closed and stored with their power adapter.
