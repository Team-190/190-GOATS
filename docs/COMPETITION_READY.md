Successful robots are consistent in their performance and reliable in their function.  We achieve this with:
* Clear understanding of the game mechanics and strategy
* Prototyped designs to prove concepts
* Thoughtful layout of components to ensure it is easy to maintain and debug
* Planned placement of electrical components
* Methodical bring up of subsystems in programming
* Well-tested mechanisms and programming
* Extensive driver/operator time with the robot on a complete field.
* Practicing all parts of a team at the competition, including on-field robot setup and removal, selecting and running autos, practicing under time crunches and in distracting environments,

# 1 Competition-Ready Plan
* At least 50 hours of driver practice on a robot prior to competition.
* At least 50 tests of any unchanged autonomous mode before it is deployed for competition.
* At least 3 full practice inspections, preferably with volunteer inspectors, at least one week prior to competition.
* Complete inventory of road cases, including adequate spare parts, at least one week prior to events.
* Pre-scouting of teams in attendance of the event.

This will enable us to meet the following team at-competitino goals:
* Able to pass inspection immediately upon arrival and in a single session.
* Have a fully functional robot every match with predictable performance.
* Able to fix any issues and make repairs quickly by design.
