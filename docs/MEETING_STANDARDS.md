# 4 Meeting Standards

## 4.1 Types of Meetings

Work Hours
* These are blocks of time used primarily for working on specific tasks related to the team, whether robot, outreach, or competition-related.

Stand-Up
* At the conclusion of each set of Work Hours, the team holds a Stand-Up.
* Everyone gathers on the field (or lab if another team is practicing) in a circle.
* Task leaders provide a quick update on what was achieved that day.  Clarifying questions may be asked but this is not a space for intense discussion.
* At the conclusion, task leaders must write their update in Slack for anyone not present.

Competition Prep & Packing
* Prior to events, additional time may be added to close the pit cases and pack the trailer for the event.
* If specifically added, this will typically be the day before the event.

## 4.2 Hands Up
When raising our hands at meetings, there are different meanings for the number of fingers displayed. 
The following are our Hands Up Codes: 
* 5 Fingers — Raising hand to ask a question, vote, etc. 
* 4 Fingers — Raising hand to emphasize a focus on our Team Goals. 
* 3 Fingers — Raising hand to request that we take a break; typically during a team meeting. 
* 2 Fingers — Raising hand to request that we move on to another topic (i.e.we have been talking too much on the current topic/we are just wasting time).
* 1 Fingers - Raising hand (index finger) to show silent support for an idea being presented or discussed. 

For 2 Finger & 3 Finger Hands Up, the team captains or whoever is leading the discussion will determine if we have met the threshold to move on to the next topic or take a break.

## Voting on Decisions
When making team-wide decisions on requirements or other major issues, we employ the process described below.  Our goal is to make decisions by consensus and not majority rule whenever possible.  

* Time-limited discussion on key issue:
  * Raise hand to be added to speaking queue
  * Cede time when someone else has already made your point
  * Use 'Hands Up' codes to communicate with moderator
* At intermediate points, the moderator will call for a vote to poll the room
  * All votes are done by heads-down, hands-up process so people can feel comfortable voting for anything of their choosing or abstaining from voting
  * The moderator will count the votes
  * If the vote is split, the discussion continues
  * If the vote is close (i.e. less than 10% have voted for one side), those voting for the minority opinion are asked to give final key arguements, and then we will revote
  * If the vote is definitive or no one voting for the minority is willing to speak, the moderator will make the call and we will move to a new discussion
* If the team is struggling to come to consensus, the moderator may
  * Table the discussion until later
  * Make a plan for further research and a later group meeting to review the research
  * Ask for a 'die on this hill' vote, where we ask people to vote only if they feel so strongly they would leave the team if the alternate option is chosen
  * Employ the 'sad panda nuclear option' of a strictly majority vote if they feel all the points have been made and no one is shifting their votes despite multiple straw polls, etc.
