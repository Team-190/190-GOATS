# 4 Meeting Standards

## 4.1 Types of Meetings

Work Hours
* These are blocks of time used primarily for working on specific tasks related to the team, whether robot, outreach, or competition-related.

Stand-Up
* At the conclusion of each set of Work Hours, the team holds a Stand-Up.
* Everyone gathers on the field (or lab if another team is practicing) in a circle.
* Task leaders provide a quick update on what was achieved that day.  Clarifying questions may be asked but this is not a space for intense discussion.
* At the conclusion, task leaders must write their update in Slack for anyone not present.

Competition Prep & Packing
* Prior to events, additional time may be added to close the pit cases and pack the trailer for the event.
* If specifically added, this will typically be the day before the event.

## 4.2 Hands Up
When raising our hands at meetings, there are different meanings for the number of fingers displayed. 
The following are our Hands Up Codes: 
* 5 Fingers — Raising hand to ask a question, vote, etc. 
* 4 Fingers — Raising hand to emphasize a focus on our Team Goals. 
* 3 Fingers — Raising hand to request that we take a break; typically during a team meeting. 
* 2 Fingers — Raising hand to request that we move on to another topic (i.e.we have been talking too much on the current topic/we are just wasting time).
* 1 Fingers - Raising hand (index finger) to show silent support for an idea being presented or discussed. 

For 2 Finger & 3 Finger Hands Up, the team captains or whoever is leading the discussion will determine if we have met the threshold to move on to the next topic or take a break.
