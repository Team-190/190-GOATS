# 2 Two-phased Iterative Build Strategy (TIBS)

The team will aim to build two robots, Gamma and Delta.  The objective is to get a good, early-week robot done as quickly as possible, maximizing available programming and driver training time.  While programming and driver practice is taking place on Gamma, the design team will move on to Delta, learning from the experience of Gamma and the community to improve the overall design and effective strategy.

## 2.1 Gamma
In the first three weeks of the build season, we will design, build, and mechanically complete a FRC-legal robot that could, with another partner like itself on the field, consistently win, get at least one bonus Ranking Point, and contribute to the other bonus Ranking Points every match. 

We achieve this by:
* Reading the rules of the game thoroughly after kick-off to ensure an understanding of the point structures and major game limitations.
* Designating a small group of strategically experienced team members to be responsible for reviewing other previous games similar to the current game and benchmarking expectations of the game.
  * What they think the typical match score will be of a team during the various weeks of competition
  * What actions a robot needs to complete (and how many times) in a match to contribute at least half the effort to each bonus RP
* Choosing to focus on the task(s) with near unlimited scoring potential or higher scoring potential that also contribute to a bonus RP.
* Determining a stream-lined mechanical design, through research and prototyping, that will allow the team to design, manufacture, and assemble the robot completely within 3 weeks.  Integration between subsystems will be limited to maximize parallel development time.  
* Releasing a completed robot to programming and drive team for development, tuning, and practicing at 3 weeks.  
* Maintaining the Gamma robot and making small improvements if needed during development time to ensure it’s operating at its maximum potential, and remains functional and able to be brought to an early season competition.
* Understanding that the Gamma robot is likely to compete in Week 0 and any early season events (Week 1-3) as the team’s official entry, so it needs to be competitively robust, but only for early gameplay.  

## 2.2 Delta
After completion of Gamma, the data from the beginning of the season is reviewed, along with anecdotal data from Open Alliance teams and others, to determine if our assumptions remain accurate.  With that information, the team proceeds to brainstorming and prototyping on a robot that can achieve at least one bonus RP on its own, and as much as reasonable of the other bonus RP (minimum ½ required action or points).  

We achieve this by:
* Evaluating strategically the best way to achieve the bonus RPs, understanding it may be an improvement upon Gamma or a different approach and design.  
* Making a clear list of the functionality the robot must achieve or features it must have to drive the design integration process.
* Having regular design reviews to ensure everyone is working towards the the agreed objectives and that there will be minimal surprises in integration
* Ensuring adequate space and access for all components through pre-planned design, including electronics, for consistent performance and maintenance.
* Utilizing all members of the team for the skills they can offer, distributing work across people’s strengths to minimize burnout while leveraging the unique skills of our team.

__No matter if it is an iteration or complete overhaul of Gamma, Delta will be a standalone robot.  At no point will the functionality or availability of Gamma be compromised for the development, design, or implementation of Delta.__
