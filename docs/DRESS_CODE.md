# 2 Team Dress Code 
* All team members must adhere to a common sense dress code when working with the team or on team activities.  This includes but is not limited to: 
  * Team members must wear clothing that covers one’s undergarments and private parts.
  * Team members must NOT wear clothing that depicts violence, obscenities, pornography, nudity or sexual acts in any manner. 
  * Team members must NOT wear clothing that displays hate speech targeting groups based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion. 
* In addition: 
  * Long hair must be tied back when working with any power tools, machines, or in the robot. 
  * Jewelry is not acceptable if it can entangle into robot parts or into machinery, and is generally discouraged. 
  * Closed-toe shoes must be worn at ALL times. 

## 2.1 Team Apparel 

If you are wearing a team shirt or any piece of team apparel, you are representing us regardless of where you go. Do NOT behave inappropriately while wearing team apparel. 

Shirts and other team apparel may not be modified such that the team logo or sponsor logos are altered unless prior permission has been granted.  They also may not be modified in such a way that becomes distracting during the event.

## 2.2 Receiving Team Apparel

At the start of each season, team members receive one team t-shirt of their choosing.

Upon establishment of the Varsity Team in mid-February, each Varsity Team member may also take one sweatshirt and an additional t-shirt.

## 2.3 At Competition 

At competition, it is important for the team to maintain a unified image. As such, we require all team members who are attending as part of the team to wear a modern logo t-shirt that is a red or black base.  Throughout each competition, team members may not cover their team t-shirt with any outerwear that is not also branded with a modern team logo. 

On practice days of competition, the team may decide to relax the standards and allow previous years’ shirts. The team may also decide to create a specific t-shirt for an event, in which case that t-shirt will be an option to wear in place of the current year’s t-shirt. Details will be relayed to the varsity team before each competition.
