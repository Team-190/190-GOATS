# 2 Team Decision-Making Philosophy

The goal on our team is to make decisions by group consensus whenever possible.  We think it is important for ownership of tasks and processes for the group to participate.

However, ultimately not all decisions can be made by group consensus.  Factors such as time (how long to make a decision), experience (background knowledge to make an informed decision), and road blocks (inability of the group to come to agreement) can all result in decisions needing to be made outside of the full team.

For times when decisions are made outside the whole team, the Core Leadership will be the next step in making a decision.  Ultimately though, the responsibility of that decision falls on the following people:

* Core Leadership
  * Team Culture
  * Season Schedule
  * Varsity Team Requirements
* Team Leaders
  * Team Administration (travel, logistics, meetings, etc)
  * Attendance and Discipline
  * Competition Role Selection (with Technical Leaders)
* Technical Leaders
  * Strategic game objectives (with Team Leaders)
  * Robot Creation & Scope
  * Manufacturing Priorities and Outsourcing
