# 5 Workspace 

## 5.1 Understanding Our Workspace
WPI has generously provided the workspace for FRC190 at 15 Sagamore Rd.  It is a great privilege to have such a space, and as such we must be respectful and professional in our use and management of the space.  

The Workspace consists of four main areas: the Lab, the Shop, the Field, and the Airlock.

### 5.1.1 The “Lab”
* The Lab is located in SA 140.  
* This is the team’s dedicated workspace.  It includes:
  * 3D Printing Area
  * Communal work tables with TVs for collaborative design and programming
  * Storage of team backstock 
  * Storage of part movers 
  * Team Laser Cutter
### 5.1.2 The “Shop”
  * The Shop is located in SA 148.
  * This is a machine shop managed by the Robotics Resource Center and whose primary users during the build season are FRC 190 members.  It includes:
    * Manual Mill
    * Manual Lathe
    * Drill Press
    * Vertical Bandsaw
    * Horizontal Bandsaw
    * Belt Sander
    * CNC Router
    * HAAS VF4-SS
    * Powder coating equipment
    * Hazardous Materials Storage
* Students are never granted key card access to the machine shop, and may never enter without an authorized mentor present and overseeing their work.  
* PPE is available immediately outside the shop door.  This includes safety glasses, hearing protection, and hair ties.
* Safety and behavioral rules are strictly enforced in the Shop.  Failure to comply may result in immediate dismissal from the team.  

### 5.1.3 The “Field”
* The Field is located in the open space in SA 144.
* The Community Practice Field is managed by FRC190 and open to all FRC teams in the area.
* In addition to the field, there is storage and space for basic hand tool usage outside the field for FRC190 or other teams when they are on-site.
* Safety glasses must be worn at all times when on the field or within two feet of the field and robots are operating.  
* The Field area also has a CRUD table for the team that may be used outside of designated work hours only.  

### 5.1.4 Quiet Room
* The Quiet Room is located in SA 141.
* This is a casual space for the team.  It also has a couch as a space to decompress or have a private discussion.
* Per the Minor’s Policy, minor’s can never be in this room with only one other person and the door closed.

### 5.1.5 Other Spaces and Resources  
* Honor Fridge
  * Snacks and drinks are available for team members.  They cost $.50 each.  You may take something if you are hungry or thirsty, and prepay, pay at the time, or pay later.  It’s an honor fridge because we trust people will pay what they owe.
  * Snacks or drinks in the open space of the team are no cost.
* Cart Cart
  * A variety of items are available for taking from the Care Cart.  The intention is that sometimes people need access to elements to help them be healthier and happier.  This could be something you need to get through the day, something you or your family need at home, or something you were too busy to go out and get.
  * You may always take from the Care Cart if you need.   If you have the means to replace or add to the Care Cart you may, but it is absolutely not required.
  * If you need something that is not there, you can add it to the sheet.  If it’s something more private, you can put a note under Colleen’s keyboard and we will do our best to get it.  There is never a need to identify yourself or will we ever judge you for needing something.  

## 5.2 Workspace Access
* Team members may request key card access to the building at the start of the season using the Slack channel #cardaccess.  
* Team members must use their ID to tap into the building or individual spaces at all times.  Piggy-backing (i.e. walking in with someone who tapped their ID) is frowned upon in all cases.
* Team members who do not have a WPI or Mass Academy ID should contact team leadership about receiving one such that they may access the building.
* Key card access to specific spaces within Sagamore will be granted on a case-by-case basis.

## 5.3 General Workspace Rules
* Team members are welcome to access the space and use it for meetings, homework, etc.  However, during team designated work time, any non-team activities may not use the space.
* If you wish to borrow a piece of team equipment outside of a meeting, ask the responsible mentor that uses the equipment. 
* Follow all safety guidelines and protocols. 
* Use of team tools is a privilege, not a right, and safety is paramount. 
* Do not use a machine or tool unless you have been trained and signed off to use that equipment. 
* Return all tools and equipment to their given places. 
* Do not download or install programs onto the programming or CAD computers without the permission of leadership and a reason directly related to robotics or the team.

## 5.4 Clean Up and Workspace Maintenance
* Everyone is responsible for maintaining a clean and safe work area.
* Regardless of what you worked on that day, everyone is responsible for participating in cleaning up from the day’s work.
* At the end of each meeting, there will be a dedicated “Clean 15”, at which time every member in attendance will help clean up the space that was used. If members are staying later than the official meeting time, the Clean 15 will still happen at the end of the official meeting time, and anyone staying later will be expected to leave their workspace clean.
* If someone has to leave early, they must still dedicate the 15 minutes before their departure to clean up.  Failure to do so will have the person marked ‘unproductive’ for that work session.
* Mondays during Build Season will also begin with 20 minutes of designated cleaning, organization, and inventory overview.  Each person will be assigned a specific maintenance task for that day to complete prior to team tasks.
* More specific list…  coming soon
