# 3 Team Organization
## 3.1 Mentors
Our mentors consist primarily of undergraduate students from WPI, with industry professionals and WPI staff to guide and oversee the entire team.  Most mentors are FIRST alum from diverse teams that bring unique perspectives and experiences to the group.  The team is an important learning and growth experience for our college mentors as much as our high school students.  Mentor participation and support is integral to the success of our team.

## 3.2 Students
Our students consist of two core groups:
Mass Academy of Math and Science Students - as the primary high school associated with our team, MAMS students are automatically granted membership on the team, although must still meet Varsity Team standards to be considered accordingly.
Other High School Students - any other high school student is allowed to apply to participate in the team.  It is expected that non-MAMS join the team with the interest and ability to meet Varsity requirements.  If an abundance of applications are received, the Core Leadership may limit accepted students to those with no current access to robotics program, and a focus on freshman and sophomores.  Non-MAMS students who meet Varsity requirements are guaranteed acceptance onto the team the following season.

## 3.3 Student Leadership
Student Leadership typically consists of two Team Captains who are seniors on the team.  If no suitable person(s) is available in any given year, it will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

### 3.3.1 Role of captain
The Team Captains are responsible for keeping team unity, advocating for students and their experience, running team meetings, and being team spokespersons.

They work to ensure the team is a welcoming and supportive space.

## 3.4 Core Leadership Team
The Core Leadership Team consists of the Team Leaders, Technical Leaders, and Team Captains.  This group will meet on a regular basis to discuss and address any issues or improvements on the team.  They will also coordinate upcoming events and make any necessary adjustments for the upcoming weeks of the season.
The Core Leadership team consists of:

3.5 Opportunities to Lead
Everyone on the team has the opportunity to lead, with or without a title. This can range from leadership on a subsystem to simply setting an example of attitude. Well-respected leaders remain positive when working with their teammates, take initiative, and lead by example by following policies, helping to educate their teammates, not pushing others aside, keeping our workspace tidy and respectable, etc. 
We strive for all students and mentors to become ambassadors of our team who share our goals, core values, philosophies, processes, experiences, and enthusiasm to those outside of our team.  Ambassadors are informed, experienced, well-spoken, positive, friendly, and engaging.
