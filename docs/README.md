# FRC 190 Team Handbook
This document is intended to contain the information needed for all 190 team members to understand the standards procedures for FRC Team 190. It is updated yearly by Core Leadership to accurately represent the current state of the team.

This is a working document being developed in the 2024-25 season and may have entire sections missing or incomplete at this time.

Some content of this handbook is directly inspired by or taken from the handbooks of FRC 1678, FRC 118, and FRC 254.  We thank them for sharing their documents with the community to build off of and learn from!

## Congratulations on joining the HERD!

### Expectations of all Team Members (Mentors and Students):

* We constantly work to meet our goals, mission and vision.
* We strive to uphold our team motto: Integrity Above All, Service Before Self, Excellence in Everything.
* We understand we represent our school and sponsors anytime we are with the team or wearing team apparel, and act in a way that would make them proud.
* We understand that participating in robotics should not be at the cost of taking care of ourselves or our other responsibilities.  We speak up if we are struggling and we work together to find solutions.  
* Mentors lead by example on all fronts, from how we act at events to how we take care of ourselves and our priorities.
* All team members shall adhere to all policies and procedures set forth by the team.  Mentors shall follow the FIRST Youth Protection Policy and WPI Minorâ€™s Policy.
* We look out for and speak up for each other.
